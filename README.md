# eu.cywa.wcf.clanwars
Clanwars is a match organizer plugin for cyber sport teams in WCF. It supports a number of games for organizing results in the backend and display them in the frontend.

## Installation
Simply download the package eu.cywa.wcf.clanwars.tar from GitHub repository or [Woltlab Plugin Store](http://woltlab.com). After that you have to login into your WCF system and navigate to `Administration > Packages > Install package`. Select the package from your local computer and click on install. You got it!

## Preferences 
There are no special preferences for now. I planned some for the near future including a feature for adding your own games to the database.

## Add and edit a match
To add a match navigate to `Community > Clanwars > Add match` and fill out the specific fields. If you recognize an error in any match data navigate to `Community > Clanwars > List matches` and click on the pencil in the specific match line.

## Permissions
Clanwars include some permissions for administrative use including adding, editing and deleting matches. To find those navigate to `Users > User groups > List user groups`. Edit the specific group and click on `Administrative Permissions > Community`.

I also included a permission to restrict the view of the clanwars page in the frontend for any usergroup. Therefore you have to navigate `General Permissions > Forum`.

I want to thank everyone who helped me developing this plugin and want to thank everyone for his time.
